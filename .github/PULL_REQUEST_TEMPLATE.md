Before submitting your PR, please review the following checklist:

- [ ] **CHOOSE CORRECT BRANCH**: if filing a bugfix/enhancement use `master` branch
- [ ] **TEST**: run "npm test" before commiting
- [ ] **TEST MORE**: run "npm install" to check if dependencies are OK
- [ ] **LIST ISSUES** this PR resolves
- [ ] **KEEP PR small** so it could be easily reviewed.
- [ ] **AVOID** making unnecessary stylistic changes in unrelated code
